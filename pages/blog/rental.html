<h1>Future predictions: we'll rent everything</h1>
<i>(2020-04-10)</i>
<p>&emsp;
In the future I think we'll rent way more things than we rent now.
This will be by choice of course; people who really want to own things will still be able to.
But I think the vast majority of people will choose to rent rather than own a significant portion of their property.
</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>&emsp;
Think about how what percent of your time you spend using your vacuum cleaner.
(if you don't have one, pretend you do)
Your answer was probably 1% or less.
But what percent of your time do you spend owning your vacuum cleaner?
Almost definitely 100%.
</p>
<p>&emsp;
Doesn't this seem like a waste to you?
In theory, we could make at least 100x less vacuum cleaners and fill everyone's need.
Extrapolate this to most other things you own and we end up making a small percent of the things we make now without using them any less.
Or we could fill all that unused manufacturing time by making more types of things, more personalized things, etc.
In either case, the stuff you rent will probably end up costing you a lot less.
</p>
<h2>Implementation details</h2>
<p>&emsp;
As usual, our nice little utopia is bogged down in implementation details.
</p>
<ol>
<li>How do you indicate to the vacuum rental company that you need a vacuum cleaner?</li>
<li>Once they know you need a vacuum, how will they get it to you?</li>
<li>Once you're done with the vacuum, how will you return it back to them?</li>
</ol>
<p>&emsp;
Question (1) is relatively easy nowadays:
a website, an app, a voice assistant, etc.
This wouldn't have been as easy a decade or two ago, which is probably one of the reasons we dont have much of this type of renting right now.
Question (3) is also pretty easy.
Once you're finished vacuuming, tell the website/app/alexa that you're done.
You can put the vacuum out on your front porch and have someone grab it.
Question (2) is the real difficulty, and I think it's the main reason we don't have rental at a large scale right now.
Who wants to wait a few days for a vacuum cleaner to arrive when they can just own one and never have to wait again?
The answer to this mostly relies on having waaaay faster delivery, which I covered <a href="">here</a>. <!-- TODO -->
As a TL;DR, better automation, self-driving cars, more warehouses, and predicting what people are going to buy before they buy it will all help out.
</p>
<p>&emsp;
Renting would probably be most ideal for people living in cities.
I imagine (somewhat stealing this idea from BOOK TITLE TODO) apartments with a place on the wall where orders can come in.
You ask Alexa for a pencil, and ideally there's a pencil in or near your apartment building, which is quickly sent over to your hole in the wall, where it pops out.
Once you're done using it, you tell Alexa and then put it back into the wall
It gets sent over to the next person who needs a pencil, and the cycle continues.
</p>
<h2>What sort of stuff will be rented?</h2>
<p>&emsp;
Increased rental will take time to work its way into our economy and culture.
At first, people won't be comfortable trusting it and delivery times will be long.
This means that non-essential and non-time-sensitive things are the best candidates for what'll be rented.
Home improvement and cleaning tools come to mind as perfect candidates.
</p>
<p>&emsp;
Rentals that happen very regularly are also good candidates: <!-- TODO I kinda gave up on wording here -->
there are already services where you can rent clothes and swap them out once a month for different ones.
Delivery times aren't an issue for this, since the rental company can know beforehand when you'll want to have something delivered.
</p>
<p>&emsp;
Things you use very often are bad candidates for rental.
You wouldn't want to have a rental phone or a rental fridge since you use those all the time.
</p>
<h2>Services &gt; Rentals</h2>
<p>&emsp;
As I talk about <a href="">here</a>, <!-- TODO --> many things we associate with ownership right now will become services in the future.
Why rent a coffee machine when you could have coffee delivered to you every day instead?
Why rent a self-driving car when you could just pay one to drive you?
Why rent a lawnmower when you could just pay someone to mow your lawn?
Etc.
