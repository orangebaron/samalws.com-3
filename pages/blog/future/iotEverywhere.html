<h1>Future predictions: IoT everywhere</h1>
<i>(2020-06-09)</i>

<p>&nbsp;
Talk of IoT is usually boring as hell and a bit unimaginative, so let's paint a picture of it first before we get into the why.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
Your lights automatically turn on when you wake up, and your curtains automatically open to let light in.
Your drawers and doors can open automatically, or when you tell your computer to open them: no manual labor necessary.
Light switches and door handles are for boomers: you don't even have them, opting for computer control instead.
Your thermostat changes the temperature based on your body temperature, or when you tell your computer to change it.
Your fridge is connected to your computer.
(Smart fridges are dumb -
why give them a mind of their own when you could control them with your main voice assistant like everything else?)
The fridge opens automatically, and can tell you what's in it and what's running low.
With your permission, your computer can automatically order things you run out of.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
Your computer's access isn't limited to inside your house.
Car doors, windows, and ACs are controlled by computer, rather than handles and knobs.
Construction equipment is computer-controlled as well, allowing people to work on construction from home, and eventually for construction to be automated.
Even reading lights and reclining seats in planes can be controlled by computer.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
This version of IoT is much bigger than a few smart-home gadgets.
Things that previously weren't even controlled by electronics will be taken over by electronics and connected to the internet.
Things that previously had manual control will lose this manual control in favor of computer control.
You'll be able to tell your surroundings what to do, and they'll follow your command.
Using lots of sensors, your computer will also figure out what you want your surroundings to do before you even have to say it.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
The switch will be gradual.
The first step is competent voice control systems, like Alexa but better.
Next, more and more of your things will have internet access and APIs for your computer to control them.
Eventually it'll seem weird for things to <i>not</i> have computer control, and we'll demand computer access to previously non-electronic things.
Finally we'll wonder why manual control methods, like door handles and light switches, are still there, and they'll gradually go away.
