<title>online education</title>
<h1>Future predictions: online education, mostly</h1>
<i>(2020-06-16)</i>
<p>&emsp;
Education sucks right now.
We memorize things that we could easily look up online instead.
We go to see lectures in person when it would be a better experience online (except for That Guy who asks a million questions).
We're sorted by age rather than ability.
Before college, we're all taught pretty much the same stuff regardless of interests
(and this stuff is mostly determined by, at best, unelected bureaucrats and, at worst, standardized test companies).
In college, we're forced to pay excessive amounts of money for crappy housing and dining,
even this has nothing to do with education.
(And, again, we're forced to learn a bunch of stuff we don't care about.)
After college, we have pretty much no learning options available at all.
Etc.

Technology can fix a lot of these problems.
I picture a future educational system as a bunch of online lecture videos;
texting, calling, and in-person conversations for tutoring help;
and customized online exercises and tests.
These tests would give certificates at the end, so you can show off what you've learned.
All of these are possible and exist (more or less) today.
This would be better because...
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Lectures would be way better.
You can play the easy parts at higher speed and you can replay the harder parts.
You can also watch anytime, anywhere.
</li><li>
Lectures are optional, so people who prefer reading could do that instead.
Tutoring is also optional, so people who find a subject really easy can just skip right to the test.
</li><li>
It saves the lecturers' time.
Lecturers only have to lecture once total, not once a semester.
</li><li>
The complete separation of lectures and tutoring allows for good lecturers to only lecture,
and for good tutors to only tutor.
Division of labor is usually a good thing.
</li><li>
The exercises would be customized.
The algorithm would keep the pacing just right,
give you more help on areas you find hard,
and let you skip through areas you find easy.
</li><li>
You can choose what subjets to learn.
Bureaucrats or companies or college administrators can't tell you what to learn.
You can choose what you need to learn, and what you're interested in.
</li><li>
Grade level doesn't matter.
You can learn hard subjects whenever you're ready, even when you're young.
You can learn easy subjects even when you're older.
You can learn things even after you graduate from college.
</li><li>
It's cheaper, since you don't have to pay for campus dining and housing, and since less money has to be paid for lecturers and buildings.
</li>
