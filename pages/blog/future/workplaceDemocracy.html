Corporations are bloated.
I'm not going to make too much of a case for this here, since Dilbert already does it for me.
So the question now would be: how will they get better?
Since more efficiency wins out in the long run, we can tell that if we find a better model it'll probably take effect.
</p>
<p>&emsp;
Here's what I suggest: using tech, companies will begin to automate away many of their leadership positions.
We're already beginning to see this, with Jira etc. taking the place of bosses keeping track of their workers' progress;
some meetings being replaced with chat rooms, emails, and video conferences;
and paperwork being replaced with computer systems.
Managers and secretaries are able to do more with their time, or they're being fired and replaced by the bots.
</p>
<p>&emsp;
I think we'll end up going much further, though.
For starters, what's with CEOs and boards of directors making the high-level decisions?
They're paid boatloads of money to make decisions that could be made by the workers democratically instead.
The argument against this usually goes:
"the workers could make decions that put their own short-term needs over of the benefit of the company."
But not paying out millions a year to the CEOs etc would make up for a chunk of that.
And employees want stability, which means keeping the company thriving for a long time.
Also, most importantly, the opinions of lots of people, who know about how the company works from the inside,
is probably more valuable than the opinion of one person who probably only worked for the company as a manager.
</p>
<p>&emsp;
So why don't we have this already?
The main reason, I think, is that it's hard to get thousands of people communicating together,
working towards a common goal,
filtering out the bad ideas from the good,
without wasting boatloads of time that could be spent actually working.
This might be changing, though.
The internet makes communication on this big a scale possible.
It makes it possible to filter out the bad ideas from the good.
It makes it possible to easily count votes from thousands of people over many different offices.
Etc.

I don't think that pure, 100% democracies will be what happens.
I think there'll be some blend of shareholders, workers, some managers,
and potentially customers that come together to make a consensus.
(The system will also vary company-to-company.)
But I do think that workers will have <i>much</i> more say, that there will be less managers, and that there'll be a tech layer
in between, lubricating the decision-making.
