<h1>Uwe Tries and Fails to Predict the Future</h1>
<i>(2020-02-01)</i>
<p>&emsp;
For this post I'm mainly focusing on the nearish future (100 years or so).
For my (probably even worse) guesses on the far future see [].
I'm also not going to discuss climate change here. For that see [].
I'm also assuming that some other major disaster (major overpopulation, asteroid impact, Godzilla attack, etc) doesn't happen.
I assume that wars don't have a major effect, and that they die down over time. For justification on that see [].
For more stuff about the technologies I mention, see [].
</p>
<p>&emsp;
The 2 major things that I think will affect the future,
and pretty much the only 2 things that inform this,
are growing material wealth and new technology.
The technologies I'll be focusing on are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media</li>
<li>AR glasses</li>
<li>Blockchain</li>
<li>Collaboration technologies, eg git</li>
<li>Cloud computing</li>
<li>Machine learning</li>
<li>Self driving cars</li>
<li>Automation (factories, farms, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'm assuming pretty much all of these develop, which I think is a fair assumption.

<h2>Decentralized Businesses</h2>
<p>&emsp;
Over the next century, I think many businesses will move their management onto blockchain.
Blockchain holds a lot of potential for this: it's possible to spend money in a way that's
anonymous, irreversible, more secure than banks, and turing complete.
</p>
<p>&emsp;
The last point deserves some attention: anything that can be calculated by a computer can be done on blockchains.
For example, I can make a contract on a blockchain that says
"This contract takes effect once person X, Y, and Z pay $100 each to this contract.
Then this contract will send money to whoever person X, Y, and Z agree to send it to, by majority vote.
This contract will be voided if person X, Y, and Z do not pay $100 within the next 2 months.
If this happens, the money sent is refunded."
It's pretty easy to see that entire businesses could be run with blockchain contracts like these.
The benefits to this are pretty substantial:
less legal issues among shareholders since the contract is completely unambiguous,
no poential for the company's money being stolen,
the potential for completely anonymous shareholders,
less legal barriers to investment between different countries,
no incorporation fees, etc.
In the future I think we'll see many businesses switching to being run completely online in this way.

I think the future will also see the rise of new, more democratic and open-source, business structures.
Picture this business: an engineering worker cooperative run on a blockchain,
with paychecks awarded automatically based on the amount of work put in.
New projects are formed automatically, with managers elected by the project's members.
The business's work is open-source (protected by patents and/or copyrights),
so to join the company all you have to do is look at their projects, choose one, and start working.
Of course, this model has some difficulties: it would require a faily complicated algorithm to run it,
and job security would be an issue (possibly give tenure-type positions to senior members?),
but it has many upsides, such as creating more of a meritocracy, lower management costs in the long run, and better worker morale.
Also, since it's run over the internet, office space is optional.
