<h1>Future Predictions: Remote Everything (with a few exceptions)</h1>
<i>(2020-06-07)</i>
<p>&emsp;
Take a look at all the things you do in your life and ask: why am I not doing this from home?
You'll probably get answers that look something like this:
</p>

<p>&emsp;
Eating and sleeping: silly question, of course I have to.
Hanging out with friends and family: because I enjoy it more in person.
Vacations, visiting nature: the from-home version of this, Google Maps, is a far cry from the real thing.
</p>

<p>&emsp;
So far, so good. But then you move on to other parts:
Shopping: I can't try on clothes remotely, and delivery takes a few days. Also, I enjoy shopping with friends.
Work: my boss tells me I have to come in to work for some reason. Maybe in-person meetings are better somehow? Also, working from home would be lonely.
Entertainment: I mostly do this from home already, but when I do go out to see a movie or a concert it's because my friends will be there too.
In these examples, the only reasons you don't do it from home are (relatively small and easily fixed) technical problems and because doing it in-person is social.

I think many things will start being done remotely in the near future.
Robotics, widespread fast internet connection, fast deliveries, etc will allow them to be done online.
The real world will be mostly reserved for biological needs (eating and sleeping)
and enjoyment (hanging out with friends and family, taking vacations, visiting nature, and going to events).
</p>

<p>&emsp;
People will adapt to this new way of life and I think most will find it more enjoyable.
For starters, it won't matter nearly as much where you live as long as you have internet.
People will be living where they want to live, rather than wherever is close to their job.
Many will choose to live close to nature.
Many others will choose to be "digital nomads", moving from place to place whenever they want without having to worry about jobs.
People who previously had to live away from friends and family will be able to live close to them again.
</p>

<p>&emsp;
As the real world becomes a place for enjoyment, more places will pop up whose sole purposes are hanging out with friends.
Think malls and restaurants, but more focus on the social part and less on shopping and eating.
People will also go to more concerts, events, etc with friends.
Overall, the real world will become a more enjoyable place.
</p>

<p>&emsp;
Once it comes time to work, people will able to do it from the comfort of their homes.
But I think many will want to have a different place to work from.
Coffee shops seem like a good example, but there will probably also be "office rooms" that people can rent and work from.
