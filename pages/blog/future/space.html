<h1>Future predictions: space industry</h1>
<i>(2020-06-09)</i>
<p>&nbsp;
I think within the next century we'll be regularly doing space mining, manufacturing, and tourism.
I also think we'll have colonies on Mars and a bunch of moons.
Many of these colonies will be self-supporting.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
The first step to this is cheap rockets.
They'll be resusable, so the only costs will be fuel and maintenance.
SpaceX, Blue Origin, and some others are working on this right now.
Both SpaceX and Blue Origin have made mostly reusable rockets and are now working on bigger versions:
SpaceX's Starship, and Blue Origin's New Glenn.
Both will be able to take huge amounts of cargo to orbit (100+ tons, in the case of the Starship)
for far cheaper prices than anything that exists right now.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
After that would come colonies.
The Moon and Mars would be the first targets.
NASA would support them at first with the purpose of space exploration.
Later, people would come for tourism.
Maybe people would also come to colonies as refugees, pilgrim style.
But who knows.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
Once the colonies are mostly self-sustaining, new industries can be set up.
Building factories in space would be useful for some things, since the zero-gravity, the vacuum, and the extreme temperatures in space would be helpful for making things.
Asteroid mining is also really promising, since asteroids have tons of expensive resources in them.
Space energy-gathering with solar panels might also work.
The colonies would serve as starting points for these industries.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
Over time, our reach would extend further and further out into the solar system.
Using fuel we make on Mars, we could get to Jupiter's moons.
Using fuel we make there, we could get to Saturn's moons.
And so on.
I'd imagine we would also go closer to the Sun, making a colony on Mercury and maybe Venus.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
We'd also make more space infrastructure:
space elevators to easily get into and out of orbit around planets and moons,
orbiting "gas stations" to refuel,
an interplanetary internet,
etc.
