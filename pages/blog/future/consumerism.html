<h1>Future predictions: consumerism gets replaced</h1>
<i>(2020-06-09)</i>

<p>&nbsp;
For the past century or so, we've been using consumerism in order to feel good about ourselves.
But now, consumerism is showing its weaknesses.
It's a pretty expensive habit.
It doesn't improve our lives (again, aside from making us feel good about ourselves) nearly as much as it used to.
And our culture is growing more and more hostile towards it.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
We have some good replacements for consumerism now, and millenials have already discovered them:
social media, charity/volunteering, and buying experiences.
Let's go through each one, and see how they're all better ways of feeling good about yourself than consumerism.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
Social media is free, which is a huge leg up over consumerism.
Even the poor can participate and use it to feel good about themselves.
Popularity and respect is the new currency here, not money.
Social media gives you good concrete metrics for how popular you are (likes, comments, followers)
and how you compare to others.
It also gives faster feedback than consumerism.
You can post online far more often than you can buy things.
And it's much easier to see your likes, as well as other people's posts,
than it is to see how you're doing in the consumerism game.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
Charity and volunteering are also good alternatives to consumerism.
Charity usually takes up less money than consumerism, and volunteering only needs free time.
Again, even the poor can play this game.
It's arguably just as easy to brag about your donations or volunteering as it is to show off how much stuff you consume.
And, unlike consumerism, charity and volunteering directly help people, which makes it a lot more feels-good than consumerism.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
As a side note, activism is another good replacement, but it's mostly just a combination of social media and charity/volunteering
so a paragraph on it would be repetitive.
The same goes for virtue signalling, which is just activism but not effective.
Anyways, back to to the 3 replacements, let's talk about buying experiences:
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
Buying experiences is a good replacement for consumerism because it does a much better job at actually making your life better.
It was always possible to buy experiences, but I think it hasn't been popular until recently because:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Until recently, consumerism did a pretty good job at improving your life, so buying experiences wasn't as necessary.</li>
<li>Until recently, it wasn't that easy to show off your experiences. Social media makes it much easier.</li>
<li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/working-hours">People have a bit more free time now.</a></li>
<li>Remote working hasn't been common until recently. <a href="?blog/future/remoteEverything">It'll probably pick up a lot more soon.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Examples of buying experiences include going to concerts, going on vacations, and skydiving.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
Note that 2 out of 3 of these replacements for consumerism can be done for free.
For this reason, I think money will matter much less in the future, but I'll talk about that in
<a href="?blog/future/TODO">another article</a>.
