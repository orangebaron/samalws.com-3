<h1>Future Predictions: Social Media Eats Everything</h1>
<i>(2020-06-04)</i>
<p>&nbsp;
That's a bit of a clickbait title, I don't mean <i>everything,</i>
just things involving interactions between people.
And "eats" doesn't mean it'll monopolize the entire thing,
just that it'll take up a much larger share than currently.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
The main benefit of social media is letting computers think about human connections.
Things that happen on social media are computerized versions of things that happen in real life:
Accounts correspond to real-life people.
Friends and followers correspond to real-life friendship and respect.
Posts correspond with ideas or events happening in the real world.
Likes and comments correspond with people's responses to these events.
Etc.
By looking at all this with computer intelligence, we can filter good ideas from bad,
recommend people things they'd find interesting, connect people with common interests, etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
The first thing that social media ate was friendships.
Friends still interact in real life.
But they also spend a large chunk of their time interacting over social media.
I think social media can, and will, get more aggressive in other areas, where face-to-face interaction doesn't matter as much.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
Entertainment is also being eaten by social media.
It's a natural candidate for it, since much of entertainment is done on computers.
Steam is eating video games, and YouTube and Twitch are eating videos.
Streaming services are eating music, but aside from sharing playlists, they aren't that social <i>yet</i>.
Movies, TV series, and books have yet to be eaten.
(Goodreads is starting with books).
The benefit of social media for these is pretty big.
Commentary could be added to certain points in the movie/series/book, and users could be recommended with good movies/series/books.
The watching/reading experience would become shared and social rather than isolated, just like what happened with Steam, YouTube, and Twitch.

One area I think has yet to be mostly taken over by social media is news.
Right now, news is posted on social media, but I think we'll see a shift towards social media being the main source as well.
The shift can already be seen during the George Floyd riots: many videos are being posted on Twitter first, mainstream news second.
Social media is a good way to do news, since likes and followers is a pretty decent metric of how trustworthy something is.
(I'd argue it's far better than "whoever happens to own a TV station").
It'd also be good since news can come from primary sources, rather than be filtered through the major networks.
In this way, people (and social media algorithms) can judge what's important news and what isn't, rather than a few major news companies.
Fact checking will be an issue, but I think this need can be filled by "fact-checker" accounts with good reputations.
The same argument about since likes and followers being a good metric of trustworthiness applies to fact checkers as well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
As a side note, politics, which goes hand-in-hand with news, is already well into the process of being taken over by social media.
Now people have <i>(toxic)</i> political arguments all over social media, and social media posts and movements are becoming relevant in "real-world" politics.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
Another area that has yet to be eaten by social media is shopping and advertising.
The beginning of this is already happening: you can buy things directly from Instagram posts, so companies pay Insta accounts to advertise their stuff.
I envision far more of this happening in the future: companies will mainly advertise by paying influencers to post about their things,
and people looking to buy something will mainly look on social media and buy it from there.
Social media is well-suited for shopping and advertising since it gives a really easy way to filter good products from bad:
likes and comments would be the new Amazon reviews.
Accounts would gain trust from people for advertising good products and get recommended more by the algorithm gods.
Ads would be harder to ignore, since they would appear in your feed just like any other post,
rather than normal ads which are easily separated out from what you're trying to do and ignored.
Algorithms promote things for free, so good products could rise to the top of the rankings even if they don't have a huge marketing budget.
And most importantly, advertising would feel more human: real people are recommending you things rather than some brand on your TV screen.

Science hasn't really gotten that far in its social media transformation, but I think it will.
Right now science is a bit slow.
Small bits of insight aren't easily shared, so major research has to be finished before being shrared.
After it's shared, it needs to be put into a journal, which people have to wait for and then buy.
"Boring" research (often ones with negative results) are sometimes not put into a journal at all.
Social media can fix many of these issues.
They could share bits of research or whole papers on a platform.
The algorithm would recommend researchers with relevant work from other researchers, and they could leave feedback and talk with the author in a paper's comments.
Maybe they could even leave in-line comments in the PDF to point out the relevant parts.
Peer-review accounts could join the network, allowing review to be done by anyone rather than those chosen by the journals,
with the best ones rising to the top.
Scientists who want to keep their papers behind paywalls could still do so in this network, and would probably get a larger chunk of the money due to less middlemen.
Overall, this scientific social network would allow for faster publishing with less barriers to entry and less middlemen.
Academia.com starts to do this, but I suspect it'll be much more relevant in the future.

In the longer term, I think business will also be eaten by social media.
It would mainly be used for having staff share ideas under <a href="?blog/workplaceDemocracy">workplace democracy</a>.
It could also be used for recruiting/hiring and for communicating with other businesses.
Right now, this isn't really that feasible, since businesses tend to be closed-off and don't really have much workplace democracy.
But once these 2 things change (which I think they will), social media for businesses will be feasible.
