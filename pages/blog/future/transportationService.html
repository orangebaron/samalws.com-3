<h1>Future predictions: services that auto-book transportation for you</h1>

Lots of new types of transportation are being worked on.
Hyperloops, which would be able to transport people through tubes at airplane-type speeds, are in the prototype phase.
Self-driving cars, which would allow people to have a safer drive and do useful things while on the road instead of driving, are slowly moving into production.
Some people are trying to bring back supersonic airliners, with Boom Technology showing promise.
The Boring Company is looking into making much cheaper tunnels that cars can drive through.
And commercial passenger rockets are here, with the SpaceX Dragon having launched a few days before I wrote this.
Elon Musk has suggested that eventually these rockets could also be used for Earth-to-Earth transport, allowing people to get from one side of the world to the other in less than an hour.

Soon it'll be much quicker and easier to get from point A to point B.
But the complexity of booking that trip also go up.
There'll be so many more options, and I think we'll relying more and more on technology to figure out our trips for us.
I picture this as being like Google Maps on overdrive.
We'd tell it our destination and it'd present us with different routes, showing their travel times and prices.
Once we pick one, it'd automatically book all the tickets for the trip and then let us know where to go along the journey.

In this way, transportation will melt into one "thing": a bunch of seats that move you at different speeds and prices, rather than worrying too much about what vehicles the seats are in.
Instead of thinking of it in terms of "I'll drive to the airport, take a plane to Hawaii, and rent a car when I get there",
we'll think more in terms of "I'm going to Hawaii. Google Maps will figure out the details. All I know is I'll sit in a seat, get moved somewhere, walk to another seat, get moved somewhere else, etc until I reach Hawaii."

This'll put pressure on all the different industries to become as much of an easy moving-seat-service as they can
(mostly looking at you, <i>planes</i>).
Security checks will face pressure to loosen up.
Places with long boarding processes will face pressure to shorten them.
Places that need tickets will face pressure to make the ticketing process as automated as possible.
Places with lots of walking from the entrance to the moving seat (eg big train stations) will face pressure to make that walk shoter.
Etc.
