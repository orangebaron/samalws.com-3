<h1>Future predictions: fake food</h1>
<i>(2020-06-09)</i>

<p>&nbsp;
The food industry is going to go through a lot of change in the nearish future.
The general trend will be towards food that's more detached from "real" farming.
Organic food will probably stick around, but will be more of a delicacy than the sort of thing normal people usually eat (just like it is right now).
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
First off, let's look at hydroponics and indoor farming.
It's not too huge of an industry yet, but it's growing pretty quickly.
It has a lot of benefits.
Since it's indoor, it doesn't matter what season it is, what temperature it is outside, or even what part of the world you're growing the plant in.
It also can take up far less space if done in multi-story buildings, which will leave the huge amount of land previously used for normal farms up for grabs.
It can be built right next to where it's needed, be that a town or a factory.
This means less transportation costs, less emissions, and less preservatives.

Next let's look at lab meat.
It's being worked on right now, and it looks pretty promising.
The goal would be for it to cheaper than regular meat and for it to taste almost the same.
The cheapness part seems possible, since the only ingredients are a cell and nutrients for it to duplicate.
The tasting the same part might be difficult, but big strides are being made.
Once we reach that point we can start to make lab meat that's more consistent and tastes better than normal meat.
Lab meat will also have the benefit of having far less emissions and being less mean to animals, so millenials will get behind it in force.

<i>Thirdly,</i> let's look at meal replacement drinks/bars.

the idea behind them makes sense.
For meals you don't really care about, you might as well eat something that's fast and easy that gives you all the nutrients you need.
Or, in the case of protein drinks/bars, you can get more of the nutrients you want really easily.
More and more people are eating these, and I think eventually we'll be having these for most of the meals we don't care about
(ie meals like breakfast, not meals that're also social or meals that taste really good).
Meal replacement drinks/bars are as artificial as food can get, so this would be a huge win for fake food.
