<h1>Future Predictions: Oversharing Fixes the Privacy Problem</h1>

The title's a bit contradictory, so let me explain.
I think it'll get more and more useful and convenient to overshare, which will make oversharing the norm.
Once that happens, there'll be far less need to collect data without your permission, so companies will mostly stop doing it.
As for the NSA spying on people, I have no idea if that'll stop.
I'm only going to talk about the private sector here.

We already spend a lot of time on social media,
and the trend seems to be that we'll be spending more and more time on it.
As we do that, it makes sense that we would open up more and more of our lives to the public view.
A decade ago, it would've seemed crazy to post your relationship status, what food you've been eating, and what job you have online.
Now, sharing them seems completely normal.
A decade from now, I think we'll look back and find it funny that we <i>didn't</i> share our
location history, purchases, and most of our browsing history.
A decade from then, maybe we'll find it odd that we didn't share our biological data and clothing choices.
</p>

Right now, we don't share them, partly because there's no good way of doing it without looking like a weirdo.
But social media companies would benefit from having us share more, so I'm sure we'll see them work their way in.
In the example of sharing your location, Snapchat's Snap Map already broadcasts your current location.
It's not much of a streach to imagine it'll start sharing your most-visited locations soon enough,
and that clones of Snap Map will work their way into other social media networks.

Once this happens, tech companies are left with an interesting decision.
They, along with the rest of the internet, can access loads of relevant data about you.
They know most of your location history, online orders, and browsing history.
So they can choose to keep doing what they're doing
(tracking everything, even what you don't want to be known)
or they can use only your public data.
If they keep doing what they're doing, they can show you slightly more relevant ads
(I say "slightly" because you, being a good future citizen, already share a lot of data),
but they risk looking creepy and having bad PR.
Nowadays, the bad PR is worth it so they can show you more relevant ads.
But in the future I think companies will find that the PR hit isn't worth it and switch over to only using public data.
</p>
<p>&emsp;
As for the data you actually want private, companies would keep it really secure for the sake of PR.
Data wouldn't be sent without your permission (looking at you, Google Maps),
orders you want kept secret wouldn't be used in ads,
and maybe, just maybe, end-to-end encryption would finally become the standard for chat apps.
That would be nice.
