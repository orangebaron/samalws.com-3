<h1>Future predictions: blockchains, but not as much as people are hyping it up to be</h1>

What're blockchains good for?
They're not good for normal data storage or computation, since you can do those more efficiently by running a server directly.
They're not good for communication, since you can send the person a message directly instead.
None of those are ideal use cases for blockchain, since that's not what blockchain was built for in the first place.
Blockchain also isn't better for anonymity, despite what people are saying.
Identifying people by a cryptographic key rather than by name isn't a uniquely blockchain thing,
and things run by centralized servers can be just as anonymous.
Blockchain's real advantage is in creating protocols where you don't have to trust anyone.

<p>&emsp;
It might seem like a small use case, but trustless protocols are useful in a lot of things in our lives.
Money makes sense to be trustless: the world runs on money, so any weakness in the way money works could cause huge problems for the entire world economy.
Right now, banks can fail and the government could decide to hyperinflate the currency on a whim, and blockchains help to avoid both of those problems.

<p>&emsp;
Internet protocols also make sense to run using blockchains.
It doesn't make sense to have DNS be centralized.
Again, a large part of the economy runs on the web.
DNS servers can (and do) fail, or they can (and do) refuse to host websites for whatever reason they want.

The same sorts of arguments go for shopping, social media, supply chains, and contracts.
The computational and storage costs are pretty small, and the impact if the person in charge goes bankrupt or bans you on a whim are pretty big.
