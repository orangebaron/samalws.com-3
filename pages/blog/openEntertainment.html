<h1>Future predictions: entertainment goes open source</h1>
<i>(2020-04-25)</i>
<p>&emsp;
Nowadays, it's pretty easy to get entertainment for free.
Piracy is really easy now.
Streaming music and videos is free (with ads).
Streaming unlimited movies and TV (for those who don't want to go the piracy route) costs around $10 a month.
And many apps and online games are free with optional things you can buy in-game.
</p><p>&emsp;
Already, content creators are finding new ways to monetize their products.
Many musicians make most of their money through concerts.
Videos and livestreams make money almost entirely through ads and fan donations.
Free-to-play video games make money through ads and in-game purchases.
</p><p>&emsp;
For these new ways of monetizing, network effects are far more important than copyrights.
If a everyone could get a free copy of a band's song, the band would gain more money from new fans buying concert tickets than they'd lose from lost sales.
If there was ad-free access to recordings of Twitch streams, many would still choose tune in live.
People watching the ad-free recordings would increase the streamer's fanbase, which would help the streamer in the long run.
If YouTube videos could be shared off-site without any money going to the creator, the creator would still benefit.
New fans gained off-site would eventually come onto YouTube to see more, watching ads and donating on Patreon.
If free-to-play online games were open-sourced and could be mirrored on private servers, most people would still choose to play on the official server because that's where everyone else plays.
</p><p>&emsp;
The main increase in fanbase would come from people remixing and republishing the content.
People would be more likely to create remixes of music or add it to their videos if the music were uncopyrighted and open-sourced.
People would be more likely to create reactions or edits of YouTube videos if the videos were uncopyrighted and open-sourced.
And people looking at the source code of games would create mods and spin-offs that increase the game's popularity.
People want to interact with their media and make it their own, and uncopyrighting and open-sourcing the media makes this possible.
</p><p>&emsp;
For this reason, I think that most content creators in the future will choose to uncopyright and open-source their content.
Eventually, copyright law will become largely obsolete as people choose not to use it on the content they create.
</p><p>&emsp;
So aside from what I've mentioned earlier, what will people monetize instead?
Here's a lost of possibilities, largely taken from "The Inevitable" by Kevin Kelly:
<ul>
<li><b>Immediacy:</b>
People want to get things right away, even if they can get it for free later.
Potential business models based on this include paid betas, music that you can buy to get early, or streams that you can watch live with ads or watch ad-free later.
</li><li><b>Personalization:</b>
People want to have their content customized.
For example, people would pay extra to have a customized version of a book that reflects their interests and reading level.
People would pay to have a song edited to fit their own music tastes better.
</li><li><b>Authenticity:</b>
People want to have an "authentic" copy of something.
The best example of this is a signed copy of artwork.
Also, for open-source video games, companies can sell an "official build" guaranteed to be free of viruses etc.
</li><li><b>Accessibility:</b>
Downloading content is nice and all, but you have to deal with keeping the content on your computer forever.
Instead, online services can store the content for you and send it to you when you actually need it.
</li><li><b>Embodiment:</b>
Many times people would rather have things real rather than digital.
People buy physical books even when e-books are more convenient.
People will go to concerts in person even if they can watch a livestream of the concert for free.
Authors can give talks that people will pay to see in-person.
</li><li><b>Patronage:</b>
People feel good supporting content creators they like.
Many YouTubers and Twitch streamers accept donations, and I don't see why this couldn't expand out into other types of media.
</li><li><b>Networks:</b>
Creating a network of people requires organization and possibly advertising.
People will choose to play on the official server of an open-source online game because that's what everyone else plays on.
Outside of video games, a good example of monetization using networking is Goodreads.

</ul>
