<h1>Sketchy Internet Research: Climate</h1>
<i>(2020-06-04)</i>
<br />
<i>NOTE: This is only half-finished at the moment.
It's a bit janky and is missing some sources and tables.
Most notably missing is a table comparing different power sources, which ties together much of my argument but isn't really here right now.
Please don't judge this until it's actually finished. :)

<!-- TODOs:

<p>&emsp;
A lot of big, broad statements are being said about climate.
So I figured I'd go look some of it up myself.
I put my results here, in case anyone else is interested.
Take everything here with a grain of salt.
My results come mostly from websites, not fancy peer-reviewed studies.
I'm not a researcher.
I'm also a bit of an optimist, which might've biased my research.
Etc.
That being said, I think a majority of what I've found is right or almost-right.
The overall picture seems to be that as green energy tech gets cheaper,
it'll gain widespread usage just for cost reasons.
Sea level will rise, species will die, and weather will get more extreme,
but it doesn't seem like there'll be some major disaster that wipes out mankind or nature.
Anyways, enough intro.
Here's the research:
</p>

<h2>Basic Stats</h2>
<p>&emsp;
Before we get started, let's look at some basic stats.
First, the gross world product (GWP): $86 trillion. (1)
This is how much is stuff is made worldwide each year, pretty much the GDP of every country added up.
We'll use this to understand how much things cost.
</p>

<p>&emsp;
I put together a list of CO2 and energy stats by country <a href="?blog/climateDataCountries">here</a>. (2,3,4,5)
<!-- Notably, the US's emissions per capita are about double that of the EU and China.
US only uses a bit more than Canada and the Australia.
Some of this can be explained with GDP per capita differences though.
When you look at GDP, the US emits about the same per GDP as the EU[?? TODO], and about [TODO]x less than China per GDP. -->
</p>

<h2>Fusion</h2>
<p>&emsp;
If fusion works, it'd be really ideal.
The fuel is most likely really cheap: deuterium from seawater, tritium "from a lithium blanket using neutrons produced in the fusion reaction itself". (11)
It also has no bad byproducts.
The main cost would be building and maintaining them.
We have working fusion right now, problem is it uses up more power than it puts in.
</p>

<p>&emsp;
The europeans have the biggest project going on right now, ITER.
Its predecessor, JET, had a .67 power-out-to-power-in ratio. (10)
ITER's goal is to get that ratio to 5, producing 5x as much power as the amount you put in. (11)
The main problem is it's huge and complicated, so construction is expected to finish by 2025. (11)
Full experiments aren't expected until 2035. (11)
After ITER's done, the next step up is a full demonstration fusion power generator, which they plan on calling DEMO.
It isn't expected to be finished until 2048.
It would output 2000 MW, meaning that we'd need about 1300 of them to power the whole world.
</p>

<p>&emsp;
Another fusion project is being done by Commonwealth Fusion.
They're using a really strong magnet to do fusion, which will hopefully mean that the machine itself doesn't have to be as big and complicated. (13)
Their reactor, SPARC, is planned to output 100 MW of power with 1/65 the volume of ITER. (13)
SPARC's sequel, ARC, is expecrted to output 500 MW of power and be half the diameter of ITER. (14)
According to their website, the big magnet is in progress, SPARC will begin to be made in 2021, and ARC will begin to be made in 2025. (15)
From this we can probably assume that the big magnet is supposed to be <i>finished</i> by 2021 and SPARC is supposed to be <i>finished</i> by 2025.
Note that that's the same year that ITER is supposed to be finished.
</p>

<h2>Power Sources</h2>
<p>&emsp;
Let's compare some electricity sources; here's a nice little chart: (4, 6, 9, 46, 46.1, 46.2, 47)
</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Source</th><th>LCOE (new) (USD / MWh)</th><th>Power density (W / m^2)</th><th>Area needed to power the world with it (km^2)</th><th>Percent of world land area needed to power the world with it</th></tr>
<tr><th>Solar PV</th><th>32 (low), 37 (average)</th><th>108</th><th>23,148</th><th>0.005%</th></tr>
<tr><th>Onshore wind</th><th>28 (low), 41 (average)</th><th>28 (in (46)), 1 (in (46.1, 46.2))</th><th>89,286 (in (46)), 2,500,000 (in (46.1, 46.2))</th><th>0.018% (in (46)), 0.490% (in (46.1, 46.2))</th></tr>
<tr><th>Coal</th><th>33 (existing), 109 (new)</th><th>very large</th><th>small</th><th>small</th></tr>
<tr><th>Combined-cycle gas</th><th>44 (existing), 56 (new)</th><th>very large</th><th>small</th><th>small</th></tr>
</table>

<p>&emsp;
By these estimates, it's already more cost-effective to install new solar and wind power than to install new coal or gas plants.
But it's still cheaper to use existing coal than to install new gas power.
By current trends it's expected that new renewables will be chaper than existing coal by 2030, though. (7)
At this point, fossil fuel plants would begin to shut down from lack of profit and be replaced by solar and wind power.
<!-- [TODO prob show my own work for that, using (6)] -->
</p>

<h2>Power Density</h2>
<p>&emsp;
One part of my chart that I feel needs more discussion is the part about areal power density for wind power.
I figured out the energy density for wind power by extrapolating from specific wind farms. (46, 46.1, 46.2)
Wind farm (46) is probably a better example for a space-efficient wind farm, (46.1, 46.2) are probably using their space less efficiently than they could be.
But I included them for the sake of completeness.
</p>

<p>&emsp;
One common complaint I've heard about renewables is that they take up too much area.
Looking at the data, though, this seems to be pretty much false.
</p>

<h2>Batteries</h2>
<p>&emsp;
Renewables tend to be inconsistent.
The main way to fix this is getting lots of batteries.
Right now batteries cost about $156/KWh, but that's expected to decrease to $100/KWh by 2023. (16)
This is down from $1100/KWh in 2010. (16)
Assuming the world needs half a day's electric worth of batteries, the battery cost right now would be $4.7 trillion, 5% of the GWP.
</p>

<p>&emsp;
Assuming costs exponentially decrease and the rate of decrease stays the same as it was between 2010 and now (i.e. 87% per 9 years):
The battery cost for the world would decrease to $611 billion by 2028, .71% of the GWP.
It would decrease to $79 billion by 2037, .092% of the GWP.
Note that this also assumes that power usage and GWP don't increase, which are both probably both very wrong, but they push the % of GWP in opposite directions so my numbers are probably accurate-ish.
</p>

<p>&emsp;
Those numbers are cool and all but "generic average battery" isn't a product that's on the market and can be used.
An example of an actual battery that can be bought right now is the Tesla Powerwall 2.
It costs $6500 and stores 13.5 KWh. (17)
We'd need 2.2 billion of them to store half the world's electric use, which would cost $14 trillion, 17% of the GWP.
</p>

<p>&emsp;
Another alternative to batteries is pulling our nighttime power from somewhere where it's daytime, i.e. making big ocean power cables, but I haven't bothered to look into this.
</p>

<h2>Removing Carbon</h2>
<p>&emsp;
There's a lot of possible methods for removing carbon from the atmosphere, so I'll just let this article list them out for me. (42)
Most of them seem to cost about $100/ton of CO2.
Given current world emissions, this would mean we'd need to spend $3.6 trillion a year to store all the world's emissions, or 2.8% of the GWP. <!-- [TODO check math] -->
Definitely not ideal, but doable if necessary.
Of course, some of these solutions might not as scalable as we need.
You can only plant so many trees, for example.
Many of them show a lot of promise, though: the ones that end up with raw CO2 as a product can just put that CO2 into containers and put those containers somewhere safe, scaling nearly infinitely.
</p>

<h2>Emissions by Industry</h2>
<p>&emsp;
(27) lists the sources of emissions by sector. <!-- [TODO copy them here] -->
One important thing to note is that electricity and heat only make up 25% of the total.
This means that if we put our entire power grid on green energy, we'd only drop our emissions by 25%.
Other industries need to start using electric rather than gas motors before we can see an improvement there.
</p>

<!--
<h2>Carbon Footprints</h2>
<p>&emsp;
I'm breaking the average person's carbon footprint into 3 categories: electric, transporation, and food.
Other things you buy needed carbon to make, but that seems like a lot of effort to research so I didn't bother.
</p>

<p>&emsp;
Electric is pretty easy: power production in the US emits about 1 lb of CO2 per KWh. (30)
So let's dive in to some uses of electric.
The average computer uses somewhere between 60 and 300 W. (31)
Assuming you leave the computer on 24/7, you'd use between (365*24)*60/1000 = 526 lb co2 per year and (365*24)*300/1000 = 2628 lb CO2 per year.
Assuming instead that you leave it on 8 hours a day, you'd use between (365*8)*60/1000 = 175 lb CO2 per year and (365*8)*300/1000 = 876 lb CO2 per year.
Phones use a pretty trivial amount of electric: for example, a Google Pixel 4 has a 2000 mAh battery. (32)
Assuming you use one battery cycle per day, that's 2800 mAh*12V*365/1000/1000 = 12 lb CO2 per year.
The same formula can be used for everything else in your house that uses electricity.
As for appliances, I'm gonna skip showing my work and list a few out here: (33).
[TODO]
</p>

<p>&emsp;
Now for vehicles.
Source (28) lists out the greenhouse emissions for a bunch of different types of vehicles.
Here's a condensed version of the relevant table in it: [TODO].
[TODO electric cars, (29)]
Note that, despite what most people seem to be saying, planes don't emit much more per passenger-mile than other sources.
Not travelling long distances too often has a much bigger impact than not riding planes.
</p>

<p>&emsp;
Finally, let's look at food.
I'll just cut to the chase on this one.
Here's a chart, based on (34) and (35), showing the CO2 emissions from making different types of food.
Also mentioned in (34), table [#TODO], is that post-production (transporation etc.) emissions are pretty small compared to production (e.g. raising the chicken) emissions, which casts doubt on the locally-sourced movement.
</p>
-->

<h2>Sea Level Rise</h2>
<p>&emsp;
The UN climate model has a bunch of scenarios, listed on (24). <!-- : [TODO list them]. (24) -->
RCP 4.5 seems most consitent with the predictions made before: CO2 emissions per year peak around 2040 and then start to decline.
<!-- Under each scenario, here's the expected sea level and temperature rise: [TODO]. (23) -->
The expected sea level and temperature rises for each scenario are listed on (23).
Here's a handy little map that can help you see what different sea level rises would look like: (25).
</p>

<h2>Weather</h2>
<p>&emsp;
Source (37) talks about weather changes that have been happening and will probably continue.
Summary: increased temperature changes, more rain, more severe storms.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>&emsp;
According to the sources I found, it seems that we'll follow the UN model's RCP 4.5 pathway, peaking emissions around 2040 before switching over to green energy because of green power, batteries, and electric motors becoming cheaper.
Nuclear fusion is also possible, but that's still doesn't work yet.
Carbon capture also might work too: it'd use take around 2.8% of the GWP to capture all of our yearly emissions.
</p>

<p>&emsp;
All together, if we end up following RCP 4.5 as I'm guessing, we'll end up with a 0.26-meter sea level rise by 2065 and 0.47-meter rise by 2100.
Global warming will probably result in increased temperature changes, more rain, and more severe storms.
It'll probably also result in the extinction of some species.
</p>

<p>&emsp;
There are ways to make the outcome better, like making policy changes (which I didn't really look into) and lowering our own carbon footprints (see #carbon footprints above).
</p>

<h2>P.S. in Response to Michael Moore's "The Planet of the Humans"</h2>
<p>&emsp;
2 big points made in the documentary were that the mining needed to make solar and wind power emit fossil fuels, and that electric cars are pointless since the electric grid uses fossil fuels.
In response to the first here's a nice little chart showing "embodied energy" for different sources: how much energy you need to make it, as a percent of how much energy it produces. (49)
As for the second, here's another little chart showing how much emissions are made by different types of cars with the current power grid. (48)
Electric cars emit less than gas cars even on the current power grid (and would emit nothing on an all-electric grid of course).
</p>
